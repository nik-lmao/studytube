# 📚 | StudyTube

StudyTube is a Chrome extension that helps you study better by providing a distraction-free environment on YouTube.

## ⚙️ | How it works

StudyTube replaces the normal YouTube user interface with a custom one, so there are no distractions. After searching for a topic, the extension will show you the results, but not the random recommendations, like short reels or "You may also like..." div's.
